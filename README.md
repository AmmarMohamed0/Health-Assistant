This code creates a web application using Streamlit for predicting three different health conditions: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.

1. **Imports**: It imports necessary libraries such as `os`, `pickle`, and `streamlit`. `os` is used for interacting with the operating system, `pickle` is used for serializing and deserializing Python objects, and `streamlit` is used for creating web applications.

2. **Page Configuration**: Sets the page configuration like title, layout, and icon using `st.set_page_config()`.

3. **Loading Models**: It loads pre-trained machine learning models for predicting diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease from saved files using `pickle.load()`.

4. **Sidebar Navigation**: Creates a sidebar with options for navigating between different disease prediction pages using `option_menu()` from a custom Streamlit component `streamlit_option_menu`.

5. **Diabetes Prediction Page**: If the user selects "Diabetes Prediction" from the sidebar, it displays input fields for various attributes related to diabetes risk factors like pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, etc. Then, when the user clicks the "Diabetes Test Result" button, it uses the loaded diabetes prediction model to predict whether the person has diabetes or not.

6. **Heart Disease Prediction Page**: Similar to the diabetes prediction page, this section allows the user to input various attributes related to heart disease risk factors like age, sex, chest pain type, etc. It then uses the loaded heart disease prediction model to predict whether the person has heart disease or not.

7. **Parkinson's Prediction Page**: This section allows the user to input various attributes related to Parkinson's disease risk factors like vocal fundamental frequency, jitter percentage, shimmer, etc. It then uses the loaded Parkinson's disease prediction model to predict whether the person has Parkinson's disease or not.

8. **Prediction and Display**: After the user inputs the required data and clicks the corresponding prediction button, the code processes the input data, makes predictions using the respective machine learning models, and displays the diagnosis result (whether the person has the disease or not) using `st.success()`.
9. **To run the Streamlit app:** Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where your Python file is saved.
Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
`streamlit run app.py`.
